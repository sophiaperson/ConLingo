Description:
Conlingo is a game that allows a user to create a constructed language, 
whether through user inputted preferences or through computer-generated 
mappings of linguistic rules for the language. The program can also save 
the syntactic rules and generated lexicon (vocabulary) of the constructed 
language for later access. This program then allows the user to look 
through previously generated constructed languages and learn them through 
mini games.
